# Honey-Dos

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/honey-dos/web.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/honey-dos/web)

## Prerequisites

- docker >= `18.06.1-ce`
- node >= `8.11.3`
- npm >= `6.4.1`
- dotnet sdk >= `2.1.403`

## Installation

1. clone repo
2. set env variables in `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc` or equivalent startup script
   ```
   export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
   export ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=5001
   export NODE_ENV=development
   ```
3. source your startup script (ie `source ~/.zshrc`)
   - you can also close your shell(s) and open new shell instances
4. make init script executable `chmod +x init.sh`
5. Follow [Configure](#Configure)
6. (optional) edit `hosts` file add entry for local development `127.0.0.1 local.honeydos.co`
7. run init script `./init.sh`
8. Follow [Running](#Running)

## Configure

1. change `JwtIssuerOptions:Secret` _value must be at least 16 characters long_
2. change `FirebaseConfig` values, Honey-Dos firebase project -> "Get started by adding..." -> Web (</> icon)
3. change `FirebaseJson` value
   - Get the firebase json file from the Honey-Dos firebase project -> Settings (gear icon) -> Project settings -> Service Accounts -> Generate new private key
   - Reduce it to single line
   - Escape quotes `\"`
4. add secrets to `HoneyDo.Web` project by executing `cat ./dev-secrets.json | dotnet user-secrets set` in the `HoneyDo.Web` directory.
5. **REVERT** all changes immediately, do not commit these values, especially `FirebaseJson`

## Running

1. start `honeydo-db` if it's not running already `docker start honeydo-db`
2. run `npm run watch` to watch & rebuild while developing locally
   - You can initiate a nodemon restart `rs` via specifying the index than the command eg. `0:rs` for server
3. navigate to https://localhost:5001 or https://local.honeydos.co:5001 (if you added the hosts entry)

## Git Flow

- master -> PR only from dev - with version tag
- dev -> locked to prevent direct commits. PR only from feature/branches
- feature/[feature/issue#] - commit changes here

If commiting against an issue/PR, please add the `#` in front of commit message.

Example: Mike sees issue #3 on the kanban board/issues and wants to work on it. After assigning it to himself
he branches off the latest commit on `dev` and names it `feature/#3` or `feature/#3-update-readme` and then begins coding.
When Mike is finished, he commits his code with message `#3 Updated readme` and will open a PR to merge his branch into `dev`.
Once the PR is approved by Elanore, the PR will be merged into `dev`. After all features and bug fixes are completed for the milestone, the team meets up and does a release updating the version information and adding a tag.

## Coding Standards

- master branch
  - builds
  - runs
  - tests pass
- branches w/ tags created for releases
- Formating
  - Javascript
    - prettier, no errors
    - eslint, no errors
  - C#
    - vscode formatting
- PRs
  - must be reviewed
- Database schema changes are made through migrations

## Infrastructure Notes

To add a migration `dotnet ef migrations add {migration name} -p ./HoneyDo.Infrastructure/ -s ./HoneyDo.Web/ -c HoneyDoContext`

To update database with migrations `dotnet ef database update -p ./HoneyDo.Infrastructure/ -s ./HoneyDo.Web/ -c HoneyDoContext`

## JWT Notes

`JwtKey` must be added to the dotnet secrets store for development use `dotnet user-secrets JwtKey {$key}` in the `HoneyDo.Web` directory.
init.sh will prompt you for a key or will generate one for you.

## Database

- First time: `docker run --name honeydo-db -e POSTGRES_DB=honeydo -e POSTGRES_USER=honeydo-user -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres`
